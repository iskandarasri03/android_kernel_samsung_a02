menuconfig SENSORS
	bool "Sensor devices"
	help
	  Say Y here, and a list of sensors drivers will be displayed.
	  Everything that didn't fit into the other categories is here. This option
	  doesn't affect the kernel.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SENSORS_CORE
	bool "Sensors Class Support"
	help
	  This option enables the sensor sysfs class in /sys/class/sensors.
	  You'll need this to do anything useful with sensorss. If unsure, say N.

config SENSORS_LIS2DS
	tristate "STMicroelectronics LIS2DS/LIS2DS12 sensors"
	depends on (I2C || SPI) && SYSFS
	help
	   This driver support the STMicroelectronics LIS2DS/LIS2DS12 sensors.
	   It is a accelerometer device.
	   To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	   will be called lis2ds.

	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you use A96T3X6 for grip.
	  This option enables grip sensors using
	  Above A96T3X6 device driver for grip.

	  Say N here if you do not use A96T3X6 for grip.

config SENSORS_ISG5320A
	depends on I2C
	tristate "ISG5320A grip"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you use ISG5320A for grip.
	  This option enables grip sensors using
	  IMAGIS ISG5320A device driver for grip.
